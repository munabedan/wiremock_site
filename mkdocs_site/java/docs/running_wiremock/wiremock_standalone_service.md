    [WireMock Cloud offers secure, publicly hosted mock APIs with nothing to install.](https://www.wiremock.io?utm_source=oss-docs&utm_medium=oss-docs&utm_campaign=cloud-callouts-standalone&utm_id=cloud-callouts&utm_term=cloud-callouts-standalone)


WireMock can run as a standalone service,
configured via the Java API, JSON over HTTP or JSON files.
We provide the JAR file and Docker image distributions for it.

## Running WireMock

- [Running as a Docker Image](../running_wiremock/running_in_docker.md)
- [Running as a JAR file](../running_wiremock/running_as_a_standalone_process.md)

## Management

When WireMock runs as a standalone service, it can be managed through its REST API.

- [WireMock Administration](../running_wiremock/administration_api.md)
- [Admin API Reference](../reference/admin-api-reference.md)

## API Clients

There is a number of API clients that work with the standalone WireMock instance.
Check out the [Solution pages](../index.md) for more info and pointers.
